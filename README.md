# Reversing a string
## Algorithm:
1. Ask user to input a string to be reversed.
2. Store it in an array.
3. Calculate the length of the string by using the **strlen** function.
4. Apply a for loop from (counter variable= length-1) initially and decrementing the value till  (counter variable>=0) , printing the array in reverse.
